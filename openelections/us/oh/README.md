Ohio Election Results
================================

Ohio has a two-tiered results system: a [live results site](http://vote.sos.state.oh.us/pls/enrpublic/f?p=130:MYRESULTS:0) for the most recent election (the 2012 primaries at this time) and an [official results site](http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/elections/Research/electResultsMain.aspx) with individual pages for elections since 2000 and collections for elections prior to that year.

Live Results
-------------------------

The live results page has an RSS feed containing totals for individual races, as well as HTML and CSV representations of races at the statewide level and below. There is no bulk download file for all results, so individual races must be downloaded one at a time. Results on the live results site are considered unofficial.

Official Results
-------------------------

The official results pages contain statistics on voter turnout, provisional and absentee ballots, results for individual races and, in recent years, an Excel file with precinct-level data for all races ([example from 2010](http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/elections/Research/electResultsMain/2010results/2010precincts.aspx)). The individual race result pages consist of HTML tables with no downloadable formats.
