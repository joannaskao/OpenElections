The OpenElections Project aims to provide the first *free, comprehensive, and standardized* set of election data for the U.S. and beyond.

OpenElections was the brainchild of a group of journalists and open-government advocates. It is modeled on `OpenStates <http://openstates.org/>`_, a `Sunlight Labs <http://sunlightlabs.com>`_  project that gathers U.S. state legislative data.

Roadmap
-------
OpenElections is in the early stages of development. Our  project goals include:

* Create a clearinghouse of documentation on election data
* Collect and standardize historical election results
* Offer APIs for live, election night data (where available)

Get Involved

* `Code on GitHub <http://github.com/zstumgoren/openstates/>`_
* `Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openelections>`_
